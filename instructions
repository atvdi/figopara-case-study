Figopara - Case Study

This is a task for technical discussion. Candidates are not expected to fully satisfy all expectations but the majority. Do not be discouraged if you have missed 1-2 expectations.

Expectation:
 - Complete pagination feature and calculate offset.
 - By clicking detail button on the pokemon card navigate to detail page (selected pokemon's page).
 - Fetch pokemon details on the detail page using "useGetPokemonByNameQuery" and fill template with appropriate data.
 - Use an error handler if necessary.
 - Add a loading indicator where necessary.

Bonus:
- Full test coverage.
- Additional UI improvements and very well-written CSS.
